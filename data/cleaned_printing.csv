also just a warn to other ender pro user with bl touch if you go to resum a print the bl touch will not activ and might send the printer head into the bed drill hole into your magnet build plate if anyon ha suggest that would be amaz just tri one last reachout befor i remov the bl touch and go back to manual bed level i purchas the bl touch as i told my self i wa onli go to print again if i didnt have to ever manual level a bed again so hope that express how frustrat thi ha been lmao,issu with bl touch,i recent purchas an ender pro with the bltouch upgrad iinstal it and it work for about hour now it ha no idea where the buildplat should be it keep print at random height higher than it should upgrad upgrad spring glass crealiti plate aluminum extrud upgrad and capicorn tube my layer height start layer is also in my start gcode i have remov g and ad m s as i print mostli smaller part and level everytim wa take up to much time onc i start have issu g also made it wors ill explain befor when it wa work i would set the z offset save it auto home i know now that auto level home befor hand so pointless and then auto level then home again then start print and everyth would be good one day i did all those same thing and thi is when it start go wrong it wa print a good mm off of the buildplat i cycl through all the step but noth would work it would just send me on thi kind of circl check z offset it good auto home bed level auto home check z offset and it say it hasnt chang but after bed level i can see and feel that the z offset is in a differ place despit say the same locat so i would adjust the z offset auto home bed level auto home and check again and it would chang id repeat thi cycl like a madman until i eventuali give up i had a friend suggest use m and not

bike ride ani time i run out of filament sinc the shop sell a decent select of anet d filament with all that be said i see a draw back in both first let me talk about the sla i am a littl torn becaus although the print qualiti is fantast there is a ton of after work to be done to your print befor they are done and safe to use like clean with ipa which is fuck imposs to find abov right now due to covid i know i could get water washabl resin but i am skeptic as i have seen some mix review about it you also need to cure the resin in nm uv light to be abl to touch it with your hand there is also the factor of resin smell and cost which would be a problem as i intend to just use it in a not extrem ventil area i have ad a lot of thing to my amazon cart to fix these issu such as a uv solar
