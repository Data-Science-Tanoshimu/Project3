set on the elegoo mar pro sla printer or the epax x mainli becaus of the beauti print qualiti with no visibl print line and the minim setup i wa thi close to buy it on amazon but then i found out my local comput shop ha an ender and ender in stock which realli intrigu me as i could just go for a littl drive and come home with a d printer without have to sit around like a littl kid a week befor christma wait for it to ship and as i did more research the qualiti isn t even that terribl and there are lot of way to tinker improv it as well as the fact i can go on the same lil drive or even a bike ride ani time i run out of filament sinc the shop sell a decent select of anet d filament with all that be said i see a draw back in both first let me talk about the sla i am a littl torn becaus although the print qualiti is fantast there is a ton of after work to be done to your print befor they are done and safe to use like clean with ipa which is fuck imposs to find abov right now due to covid i know i could get water washabl resin but i am skeptic as i have seen some mix review about it you also need to cure the resin in nm uv light to be abl to touch it with your hand there is also the factor of resin smell and cost which would be a problem as i intend to just use it in a not extrem ventil area i have ad a lot of thing to my amazon cart to fix these issu such as a uv solar turntabl uv led strip nitril glove so expens now ultrason cleaner not realli necessari but cool and some spare safeti glass but that also bump up the price even more now for fdm the print qualiti is
